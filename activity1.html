	<p style="background-image: url('C:\Users\LENOVO\Downloads\download (6).jfif');">Lily reads through her old childhood diaries and remembers her first love Atlas Corrigan,
	 who left to join the military, but promised to return to her. While wrestling with her feelings 
	for Atlas, she meets neurosurgeon Ryle Kincaid. They are mutually attracted to one another, but 
	do not pursue a relationship as Lily is looking for commitment while Ryle is only interested in 
	casual sex. However, once Lily successfully starts her business, they continue to meet, and 
	eventually begin a relationship.</p>
